=head1 DESCRIPTION

Bubblegum::Class provides object orientation for your classes by way of L<Moo>
and activates all of the options enabled by the L<Bubblegum> module. Using this
module allows you to define classes as if you were using Moo directly.

    use Bubblegum::Class;

is equivalent to

    use 5.10.0;
    use strict;
    use autobox;

    use English -no_match_vars;
