=head1 NAME

Bubblegum::Object::Scalar - Common Methods for Operating on Scalars

=head1 VERSION

version 0.43

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bubblegum;

    my $variable = 12345;
    say $variable->or(56789); # 12345

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Scalar methods work on data that meets the criteria for being a defined. It is
not necessary to use this module as it is loaded automatically by the
L<Bubblegum> class.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 and

    my $variable = 12345;
    $variable->and(56789); # 56789

    $variable = 0;
    $variable->and(56789); # 0

The and method performs a short-circuit logical AND operation using the subject
as the lvalue and the argument as the rvalue and returns the last truthy value
or false.

=head2 not

    my $variable = 0;
    $variable->not; # 1

    $variable = 1;
    $variable->not; # ''

The not method performs a logical negation of the subject. It's the equivalent
of using bang (!) and return true (1) or false (empty string).

=head2 or

    my $variable = 12345;
    $variable->or(56789); # 12345

    $variable = 00000;
    $variable->or(56789); # 56789

The or method performs a short-circuit logical OR operation using the subject
as the lvalue and the argument as the rvalue and returns the first truthy value.

=head2 print

    my $variable = 12345;
    $variable->print(6789); # 123456789

    $variable = 'yes';
    $variable->print('no'); # yesno

The print method prints the scalar value to STDOUT, and returns true if
successful.

=head2 repeat

    my $variable = 12345;
    $variable->repeat(2); # 1234512345

    $variable = 'yes';
    $variable->repeat(2); # yesyes

The repeat method returns a string consisting of the subject repeated the number
of times specified by the argument.

=head2 say

    my $variable = 12345;
    $variable->say(6789); # 123456789\n

    $variable = 'yes';
    $variable->say('no'); # yesno\n

The say method prints the scalar value with a newline appended to STDOUT, and
returns true if successful.

=head2 xor

    my $variable = 1;
    $variable->xor(1); # 0
    $variable->xor(0); # 1

The xor method performs an exclusive OR operation using the subject as the
lvalue and the argument as the rvalue and returns true if either but not both
is true.
