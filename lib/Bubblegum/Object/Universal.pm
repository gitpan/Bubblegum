=head1 NAME

Bubblegum::Object::Universal - Common Methods for Operating on Defined Values

=head1 VERSION

version 0.39

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Bubblegum;

    my $thing = 0;
    $thing->instance; # bless({'data' => 0}, 'Bubblegum::Object::Instance')

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Universal methods work on variables whose data meets the criteria for being
defined. It is not necessary to use this module as it is loaded automatically by
the L<Bubblegum> class.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 digest

    my $thing = '...';
    $thing->digest; # bless({'data' => '...'}, 'Bubblegum::Wrapper::Digest')

    my $data = $thing->digest->data;

The digest method blesses the subject into the wrapper class,
L<Bubblegum::Wrapper::Digest>, and returns an instance. Please see
L<Bubblegum::Wrapper::Digest> for more information.

=head2 dumper

    my $thing = '...';
    $thing->dumper; # bless({'data' => '...'}, 'Bubblegum::Wrapper::Dumper')

    my $data = $thing->dumper->data;

The dumper method blesses the subject into the wrapper class,
L<Bubblegum::Wrapper::Dumper>, and returns an instance. Please see
L<Bubblegum::Wrapper::Dumper> for more information.

=head2 encoder

    my $thing = '...';
    $thing->encoder; # bless({'data' => '...'}, 'Bubblegum::Wrapper::Encoder')

    my $data = $thing->encoder->data;

The encoder method blesses the subject into the wrapper class,
L<Bubblegum::Wrapper::Encoder>, and returns an instance. Please see
L<Bubblegum::Wrapper::Encoder> for more information.

=head2 instance

    my $thing = 0;
    $thing->instance; # bless({'data' => 0}, 'Bubblegum::Object::Instance')

    my $data = $thing->instance->data;

The instance method blesses the subject into a generic container class,
Bubblegum::Object::Instance, and returns an instance. Please see
L<Bubblegum::Object::Instance> for more information.

=head2 json

    my $thing = '...';
    $thing->json; # bless({'data' => '...'}, 'Bubblegum::Wrapper::Json')

    my $data = $thing->json->data;

The json method blesses the subject into the wrapper class,
L<Bubblegum::Wrapper::Json>, and returns an instance. Please see
L<Bubblegum::Wrapper::Json> for more information.

=head2 wrapper

    my $thing = [1,0];
    $thing->wrapper('json');
    $thing->json; # bless({'data' => [1,0]}, 'Bubblegum::Wrapper::Json')

    my $json = $thing->json->encode;

The wrapper method blesses the subject into a Bubblegum wrapper, a container
class, which exists as an extension to the core data type methods, and returns
an instance. Please see any one of the core Bubblegum wrappers, e.g.,
L<Bubblegum::Wrapper::Digest>, L<Bubblegum::Wrapper::Dumper>,
L<Bubblegum::Wrapper::Encoder>, L<Bubblegum::Wrapper::Json> or
L<Bubblegum::Wrapper::Yaml>.

L<Bubblegum::Wrapper::Yaml>, and returns an instance. Please see
L<Bubblegum::Wrapper::Yaml> for more information.
